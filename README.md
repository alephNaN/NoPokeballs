Instructions:

# Google Cloud Platform Access
Before local development works. You need to authenticate, as the project needs permission
to read from datastore and cloud storage.

(1) Register a Google Cloud Platform account (https://console.cloud.google.com)

(2) Request Tuan to add you to project

(3) Install CLI for Google Cloud (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads)




# Local Development

(1) `git checkout https://github.com/alephNaN/NoPokeballs`

(2) `cd NoPokeballs`

(3) get `config.js` file from Tuan. And add in NoPokeballs directory

config.js stores string literals about the deployment / storage environment.

(4) `gcloud init`

(5) `npm install`

(6) `npm start`

(7) Check local server at (http://localhost:8080)

# Deployment

Coming soon.
